# GTKN --> GUESS THE KING's NUMBER!
Well..Don't ask me why King's Number...Maybe because you will feel a little more threatened and won't give up but keep playing until you guess it right? I wish it had ads!
A MINI GAME! IT HAS A GUI! My First EVER! WOW
Unfotunately, I lost the source code...It was like years ago when I didn't document or save things right. :/
Guess what? I still have a copy of the executable though :D

Well, I just tried playing and certain features don't work anymore which includes THE MOST IMPORTANT BUTTON!!...WELL latest Java Runtimes messing with my SWING GUI??? ;O
I could just write a much better one now but well maybe later....when I am bored and want to play a Guess The Number Game Again?
