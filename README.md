Guess The Number Java GUI
My First Ever Mini Game. Unfotunately lost the source...It was like years ago when I didn't document or save things right. :/
Guess what? I still have a copy of the executable though :D

Well, I just tried playing and certain features don't work anymore which includes THE MOST IMPORTANT BUTTON!!...WELL latest Java Versions messing with my SWING GUI??? ;O
I could just write a much better one now but well maybe later....when I am bored and want to play a Guess The Number Game Again?
